Ethan was born at full term, but his growth has been slow since the first year of life. He is currently below the 10th percentile for height and weight. His facial features are also distinctive, with downslanted palpebral fissures, a broad and angulated thumb, and a high palate. Ethan has a history of respiratory infections and feeding difficulties, and his parents report that he is a picky eater. He has also been experiencing constipation since infancy. Despite these challenges, Ethan is a happy and friendly child who loves interacting with people. His parents are concerned about his developmental delays and want to explore options for support. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. 
Ms. Smith is a 35-year-old woman with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome who presents to the clinic for her annual check-up. She has a history of intellectual disability, short stature, and distinctive facial features, including downslanted palpebral fissures, low-hanging columella, and a grimacing smile. She also has talon cusps on her permanent incisors. Ms. Smith has a history of respiratory difficulties and congenital heart defects, for which she has had multiple surgeries. She also experiences joint hypermobility and has a history of keloid formation. Despite these challenges, Ms. Smith is known for her outgoing personality and ability to establish excellent social contacts. However, in recent years, she has experienced sudden mood changes and obsessive-compulsive behavior, which have become more frequent. Her height is 4 feet 8 inches, and her weight is 120 pounds. She has a BMI of 35, which is considered obese. Ms. Smith's IQ is 45, which falls within the average range for individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. During the examination, the clinician notices that Ms. Smith has difficulty closing her eyes completely when smiling. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. 
A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency room with recurrent seizures that started when he was 2 months old. The seizures are described as brief, less than 30 seconds, and occur multiple times a day. He has also had developmental delays since birth and is currently non-verbal. His physical examination shows a small head circumference and signs of dystonia. Family history reveals that his older sister also had seizures in infancy but has since resolved. The patient's EEG showed spike wave discharges, and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Glut1 DS. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of classic glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. 
A 35-year-old woman with a history of intellectual disability, seizures, and movement disorder was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. She had a normal head size at birth, but her parents noticed that her head growth had slowed down in the first year of life. She started having seizures around 6 months old, initially with frequent episodes of eye-head movements, followed by myoclonic and atypical absence seizures. Her developmental milestones were delayed, and she was diagnosed with intellectual disability. As she grew older, her movement disorder became more prominent, with a combination of ataxia, dystonia, and chorea affecting her gait and speech. She also experienced paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia triggered by physical activity or emotional stress. The patient tried various medications and therapies to manage her symptoms, but they had limited success. Genetic testing was recommended due to the suspicion of a genetic disorder, and the result showed a pathogenic variant in the SLC2A1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of classic Glut1 DS. The patient started a ketogenic diet, which significantly improved her seizure control and movement disorder. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of classic glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. 
John is a 4-year-old boy who was born with generalized erythroderma and scaling. He has been experiencing failure to thrive, recurrent infections, and diarrhea since birth.

A 3-month-old male infant was brought to the emergency room because of his parents' concerns about his poor feeding and increasing irritability over the past week. He was born at 37 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 2.8 kg, which is slightly below average for his gestational age. His Apgar score was 9/10 at birth. The baby's medical history revealed that he had not been gaining weight as expected and had frequent emesis after feeding. He also had loose stools once or twice a day. Physical examination showed a very irritable infant with a weak cry, poor muscle tone, and a large liver and spleen. His respiratory rate was 60 breaths per minute, and he had mild respiratory distress. The baby's macula was cherry red. He was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for further evaluation and management. A diagnosis of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) was suspected based on his symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis. The baby started receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) as soon as possible to prevent further damage and improve his quality of life. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency.
A 35-year-old woman with a history of infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) presents to the clinic for a follow-up appointment. She was diagnosed with ASMD at 6 months of age and has been receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) since then. Despite treatment, she has experienced progressive neurological decline, including muscular hypotonia, weakness, feeding difficulties, global development delay, and regression of developmental milestones. She also developed interstitial lung disease, osteoporosis, and an atherogenic lipid profile. The patient's cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina has remained stable over time. The patient is now wheelchair-bound and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Her most recent liver and spleen size have increased, and she has had recurrent respiratory infections. Despite these challenges, her family reports that she remains cheerful and content, although her cognitive abilities have declined significantly. The patient's clinical features highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of ASMD to prevent or delay the progression of neurological and other non-central nervous system manifestations. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency.
A 3-day old male infant was brought to the emergency department because of lethargy, poor feeding and decreased muscle tone since birth. The baby also had some myoclonic jerks and hiccups. Physical examination revealed a hypotonic baby with a weak cry and poor reflexes. Respiratory distress was also noticed. Laboratory tests showed elevated glycine levels in blood and CSF. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Glycine Encephalopathy. The baby was immediately started on treatment with glycine-binding agents and supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. Despite early intervention, the baby's condition remained severe, with persistent hypotonia, myoclonus, and seizures. At 3 months of age, the baby had a startle-like response to vocal and visual stimuli and showed significant developmental delay. Further evaluation revealed intellectual disability, spasticity, and intractable seizures. Unfortunately, the baby did not survive beyond 7 months of age due to complications related to his condition. Genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of glycine encephalopathy.
