Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,No change,"A 5-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department by his parents with a 2-day history of vomiting and lethargy. On examination, the child appeared pale and dehydrated. Blood tests showed a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap, elevated liver enzymes, and hypoglycemia. Further investigations revealed a deficiency of long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder that impairs the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. This leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing multi-organ dysfunction, particularly affecting the liver, heart, and skeletal muscles. The child was started on intravenous fluids, glucose, and carnitine supplementation. He was also given a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to prevent the accumulation of long-chain fatty acids. After a few days of treatment, the child's metabolic acidosis and liver enzymes normalized, and he was discharged home with close follow-up. Long-term management of LCHAD deficiency involves strict adherence to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, regular monitoring of blood glucose and fatty acid levels, and close surveillance for potential complications such as cardiomyopathy and liver failure.

Further laboratory tests revealed an elevated ammonia level and metabolic acidosis. Based on the clinical features, the patient was diagnosed with Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the metabolism of fatty acids. This disorder results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites that lead to muscle breakdown and damage, causing rhabdomyolysis. The symptoms of this disorder are often triggered by exercise or illness and can include muscle pain, weakness, myoglobinuria, and elevated creatine kinase levels. If left untreated, Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency can lead to liver failure, cardiomyopathy, and even sudden death.
