He has never been able to read print or recognize faces, and has relied on auditory cues to navigate his environment. Despite his visual limitations, John has learned to adapt and uses assistive technology to assist him in daily tasks. He has also developed nystagmus and oculodigital sign (poking, rubbing, and/or pressing of the eyes) over time. Recently, John has experienced some difficulty with balance and mobility.
Past Medical History: John was diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis at a young age, and has been followed by an ophthalmologist regularly. He has also been diagnosed with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental delay.
Family History: John's parents are consanguineous, and he has several siblings who are also affected with similar visual impairments.
Social History: John lives independently and works at a sheltered workshop. He uses assistive technology to communicate and navigate his environment. Despite his visual limitations, John is active in his community and enjoys participating in sports and other recreational activities.",1,1,1,1,2,3,,
